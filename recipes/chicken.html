  <h1>Pan-Roasted Chicken with Lemon-Garlic Brussels Sprouts and Potatoes</h1>
  <img src="/img/chicken.jpg" width="500" alt="chicken pan image">
  <p>A delicious one-pan dinner that tastes like you cooked all day but only takes a small amount of hands-on time. Great flavor and easy clean-up! We make extra sprouts, my family loves them.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 slices bacon, chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 lemon, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>½ pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved</li>
    <li>8 small red potatoes, quartered</li>
    <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken breast halves</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until lightly browned but still soft, about 5 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Coat a large baking dish or cast iron skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
    <li>Arrange lemon slices in a single layer on the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
    <li>Stir remaining 5 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, kosher salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Toss Brussels sprouts in lemon juice mixture to coat; transfer to the prepared baking dish with a slotted spoon, draining excess liquid back into the bowl.</li>
    <li>Place bacon on top of the Brussels sprouts.</li>
    <li>Toss potatoes in the same lemon juice mixture used for the Brussels sprouts.</li>
    <li>Remove potatoes with slotted spoon and arrange along the inside edge of the baking dish.</li>
    <li>Coat chicken breast halves thoroughly in the remaining lemon mixture.</li>
    <li>Place chicken breasts skin-side up in the skillet; pour any remaining lemon juice mixture over chicken.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
  </ol>
